              <p>
                Spring in Japan is filled with cherry blossoms. They start
                blooming in the South of the country and make their way up North
                throughout the Spring season. Make sure to take part in
                <i>hanami</i>, which is a picnic under the cherry blossom trees
                and try one of the many <i>sakura</i> treats, like
                <i>sakura mochi</i>. Take a look at the official "Cherry Blossom
                Forecast" website

              </h3>

              <p>
                Summer offers the opportunity to visit the Japanese seaside,
                watch <i>hanabi</i> (fireworks displays) or go to one of the
                many festivals taking place all over the country. Don a
                traditional Japanese summer robe, called <i>yukata</i> and try
                one or two of the many snacks found at the festivals, like fried
                octopus balls called <i>takoyaki</i>. Also not to miss is the
                Bamboo Forest in Kyoto during the summer months.

            <p>
              Autumn in Japan is about colour! Don't miss out on Japanese Maple
              Trees that turn a beautiful blood red and a visit to one of the
              thousands of shrines. Probably the most famous shrine to visit
              during the autumn foliage season is Fushimi Inari Shrine in Kyoto.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Winter is the perfect season to head to an <i>onsen</i> town (Hot
              Spring), like Ginzan Onsen in Yamagata and warm up in the hot
              water. If you are interested in snow sculptures the Sapporo Snow
              Festival in Hokkaido will be the place to be. Many New Year
              festivals take place at shrines and it's the pefect opportunity to
              make a wish for the New Year and enjoy a hot cup of
              <i>amazake</i>, which is a sweet drink made from rice.
