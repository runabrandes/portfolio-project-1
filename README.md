# Japan - A Seasonal Travel Guide

## SITE PURPOSE

Japan - A Seasonal Travel Guide is a website that informs users about aspects of the different seasons in Japan and gives examples of activities that are a must-do during each season. It also offers a newsletter sign up, which provides the subscriber with ideas for seasonal activities taking place exclusively in Japan.

## PROJECT IDEA

My idea for this project was to create a website that informs the user about activities and seasonal aspects in Japan. My husband and I are planning to travel to Japan in 2025 and have researched the aspects of each season extensively to help us determine which of the four would be our preferred season to visit Japan. There are lots of different activities that are exclusive to Japan to choose from, like the Cherry Blossom season and a variety of shrine festivals.

  The Features I wanted the project website to have are:

* Pages are easy to read and navigate
* Images that make the users want to see more of the country
* Simple newsletter sign up form

## Site Goals
